%Create the coefficient matrix A.
A = [1 3 -2 0 2 0; 2 6 -5 -2 4 -3; 0 0 1 5 0 3; 1 3 0 4 2 9]

%Create the column matrix b of constants. Remember, to create a column matrix, the rows are separated 
%by semicolons.
b = [0; -1; 1; 3]

%Create the augmented matrix [A | b|.  Store this augmented matrix in Ab.
Ab = [A b]

%Use the rref() command to reduce the augmented matrix.  Store the reduced matrix in rowreducedAb, and 
%store the pivot variables in pivotvarsAb.
[rowReduceAB, pivotvarsAb] = rref(Ab)

%Warning:  Look carefully at the reduced augmented matrix.  If one of the pivot columns is the rightmost 
%column, the system of linear equation has no solution and no further analysis is possible.

%Do you run into any difficulties?  Explain what is happening as a comment in your code.

%Use the size command to find the number of variables in the system of linear equations.  Store this number 
%in numvars.
[numeqns, numvars] = size(A)

%Use the size command to find the number of pivot variables.  Store this number in numpivotvars.
[numrows, numpivotvars] = size(pivotvarsAb)

%Use subtraction to find the number of free variables in the solution to the system of linear equations.
%Store this number in numfreevars.
numfreevars = numvars - numpivotvars
